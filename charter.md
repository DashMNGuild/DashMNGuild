# DashMN Guild Charter

__0.0.1__

This charter is a private contract to cooperate on development of the project(s), which is to host Dash masternodes and issue a backed GDASH asset.

By linking this charter from within the a guild data repository, the members of that guild agree to abide by this charter. Each member must keep their respective branch up to date with the consensus master branch to participate in the project(s).

### Parent Guild

This guild is a child of the guild linked in the .gg submodule.

As a child guild, the DashMN Guild reserves the right to maintain their own membership, contracts, and ledger, so long as they do not conflict with those of the parent.

The DashMN Guild agrees to recognize all transctions on the parent ledger.

### Voting

Currently, Dash masternodes are not compatible with multisignature addresses. Therefore, a single key must be used, with at least one person capable of spending the balance of DASH. If many masternodes are run, different keyholders could be selected, to at least distribute the counterparty risk, but it is a singificant problem.

In the mid term, the Dash team is considering adding multisignature support for masternodes, which will allow a more secure key management scheme.

##### Vote Table

| Vote Type | Approval Threshold | Min. Vote Time | Max. Vote Time |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Appoint Key Manager | 90%        | 1 day          | 6 months       |
| Vote on Dash Budget issue | x%        | 1 day          | 6 months       |

A Dash masternode is both a dividend paying investment, as well as the requirement for voting rights in the Dash network and budget. Votes on Dash budget issues should be submitted as separate files for voting by the DashMN members. The member votes will be rounded to the nearest number of masternodes in control of the treasury, and votes will be allocated accordingly.
  
For example, if 66% of the DashMN members support a Dash budget proposal, and the Treasury controls 10 masternodes, 7 masternodes will vote yes, and 3 will vote note.

### GDASH

The primary purpose of this guild is to issue GDASH assets backed by DASH.

Each GDASH represents a claim against the DashMN Guild Treasury. This treasury is instructed to hold Dash and operate Dash masternodes. In this way, GDASH is backed by DASH, but not pegged to it.

Due to fees and revenue, GDASH may be worth more or less than 1 DASH over time.
